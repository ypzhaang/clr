# Subspace-enhanced Contrastive Learning

This repo includes the codes for studies on the impact of math education on brain development by using MRIs. The codes are focused on two brain regions, i.e., the left middle front gyrus (MFG) and the intraparietal sulcus (IPS). 

# These codes support the following paper.
[1] "Identifying Non-math Student from MRIs with An Ensemble Classifier based on Subspace-enhancedd Contrastive Learning." that would appear in the International Journal of "BMC Bioinformatics".
